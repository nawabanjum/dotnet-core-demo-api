      "title": "WiFi",
      "projectDescription": "In our fear stricken world, where collective anxiety has reached a fever pitch anticipating a global disaster around every corner, it is no surprise that our youth might escape from their responsibilities to a video game. WiFi is about one such adolescent, a teenage mother named Hope, who takes refuge in the wonderland of the internet, an alternative reality with far more allure than her life in a trailer park, and puts her responsibilities on hold as she pursues her dream of broadcasting games.A teenage mother is, after all, a child, and is unprepared for parenthood. Hope reflects this immaturity when she neglects her infant son Austin, who ends up spending most of his time under the supervision of Sara, her guardian. Sara, who is not Hope’s biological parent, treats her as if she is a hopeless burden. This coldness, along with the absence of a natural parent, drives Hope deeper into her home away from home, her streaming channel, where she spends her waking hours playing video games to an audience who shower her with the attention a child might expect from her family.Her rural environment is also unwelcoming, even hostile. Living far from any urban landscape, Hope’s community consists mostly of a few unevenly parked trailers, inhabited by people who are either critical of her situation, or apathetic. The former include a pair of sisters who are sometimes even confrontational, being secretly envious of her. Hope’s step-parent, Gerald, also Sara’s partner, ironically falls more so into the latter category, mostly indifferent to her antics, if not prompted by Sara.These characters are offset by her friends online. They are people she only knows through the internet, and does not even know their real names. They emotionally support her, and even moderate her chatroom, simplifying her life on stream. During these moments, she fails to be a mother to Austin, who is often idle, lonely and even unfed. At other times, Sara even plays the role Hope should be playing, and takes care of Austin.Sara eventually orders for the charade to end. She disconnects the wifi connection just as Hope has been planning a special cosplay stream, where she dresses up in a costume resembling the main character of the videogame, a tactic used by streamers to boost traffic to their channel, which can amount to financial gain.Still hoping to broadcast her cosplay, Hope struggles to reconnect to the internet by ironically reconnecting to her own community. In the process, she also discovers an uncanny connection to her son.",
